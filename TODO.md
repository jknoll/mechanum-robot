## Documentation & Media

- [x] Add a photo of the robot to the repo and README
  - Added placeholder photo (`docs/mecanum-robot.jpg`); replace with a better well-lit shot when available
- [ ] Add a better well-lit, well-positioned photo of the robot
  - **Requires user:** Take and provide a new image
- [x] Download and add .stl files to the `stl/` directory
  - Downloaded from Thingiverse and extracted to `stl/files/`
- [x] Add attribution and links to the Thingiverse-hosted models
  - Added to README.md and `stl/ATTRIBUTION.md`

  - **Requires user:** Record and provide the video file or hosting link

## Repo Rename

- [ ] Rename the GitHub repository from `mechanum-robot` to `mecanum-robot` to fix the typo in the repo name
  - Note: The git clone URL in README.md still references the old name and will need updating after the rename
